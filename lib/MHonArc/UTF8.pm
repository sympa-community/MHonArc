=head1 NAME

MHonArc::UTF8 - UTF-8 routines for MHonArc

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  <CharsetConverters override>
  plain;    mhonarc::htmlize;
  default;  MHonArc::UTF8::str2sgml; MHonArc/UTF8.pm
  </CharsetConverters>

  <TextClipFunc>
  MHonArc::UTF8::clip; MHonArc/UTF8.pm
  </TextClipFunc>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

MHonArc::UTF8 provides UTF-8 related routines for use in MHonArc.
The main use of the routines provided is to generate mail
archives encoded in Unicode UTF-8.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=over

=item C<MHonArc::UTF8::to_utf8($data, $from_charset, $to_charset)>

Converts C<$data> encoded in C<$from_charset> into UTF-8.
C<$to_charset> is ignored since it assumed to be C<utf-8>.

This function is designed to be registered to the TEXTENCODE
resource:

  <TextEncode>
  utf-8; MHonArc::UTF8::to_utf8; MHonArc/UTF8.pm
  </TextEncode>

=item C<MHonArc::UTF8::str2sgml($data, $charset)>

This function is designed to be registered to the CHARSETCONVERTERS
resource:

  <CharsetConverters override>
  plain;    mhonarc::htmlize;
  us-ascii; mhonarc::htmlize;
  default;  MHonArc::UTF8::str2sgml; MHonArc/UTF8.pm
  </CharsetConverters>

All data passed in is converted to utf-8 with HTML specials
converted into entity references.

=item C<MHonArc::UTF8::clip($text, $clip_len, $is_html, $has_tags)>

This function is designed to be registered to the TEXTCLIPFUNC
resource to have utf-8 strings safely clipped in resource variable
expansion:

  <TextClipFunc>
  MHonArc::UTF8::clip; MHonArc/UTF8.pm
  </TextClipFunc>

=head1 NOTES

=over

=item *

MHonArc::UTF8 tries to leverage existing Perl modules for handling
conversion to utf-8.  The following list the modules checked for
in the order of preference:

=over

=item 1

L<Encode|Encode>.  The Encode module is standard with Perl v5.8, or later.

=item 2

L<Unicode::MapUTF8|Unicode::MapUTF8>.  Unicode::MapUTF8 is an optional
module available via CPAN, and will work with Perl v5.6, or later.

B<Note:> Since it is unclear about the future of Unicode::MapUTF8,
it is possible that support for it may be dropped in the future.  It
appears to not have been updated in awhile since Perl's Encode module
will probably become the standard module to use for handling text
encodings.

=item 3

Fallback implementation.  The fallback implementation is designed to
work with older versions of Perl 5 if the above modules are not available.
