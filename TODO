TODO List for MHonArc
=====================

Items are in no particular order:

===========================================================================

=> Fix all open bugs. :-)

=> Enhance locale support, especially for message sorting.

=> Add resource to disable use of MD5 if no message-id.

=> Generalize message page layout so converted header and body can
   be placed in any order.  XXX: Old versions did not delimit
   converted head and body, so what should be done for this case
   or should any kind of compatibility be dropped?

=> Log-style output when showing progress.  I.e. Prefix text with
   date/time stamp.

=> "Global" filter options.  For example, have something like
   "subdir" be applied to all filters that write files.

=> Fix unfolding problem where there is only a single space on
   the next line.  Can this be done w/o adding extra overhead in
   parsing?  XXX: Need to remember input case where the unfolding was
   a problem.

=> Define $MhaStdout and $MhaStdin.  Should help in embedded usage.

=> Support for text/uri-list.

=> XHTML defaults for resources (XXX: Browser impact?)

=> "00" year => 1900 (need test case that verifies this).

=> Add resource to set initial message number.  XXX: Use of this?

=> Redo MHonArc using modules/class structure.  Basically a redesign
   and implementation (MHonArc 3.x?).

=> Provide attachment listing at top of each messages page
   (suggested by Lars Aronsson).  This can be tricky since filters
   have ultimate control of how parts are treated, including overriding
   attachment disposition.  Would also require changes to how base
   parsing cooperates with content filters.

=> Subject-based threading enhancements:
      . Messages with no "Re:" are in different threads.  Related to
	this is grouping follow-ups under proper message based upon
	date.

=> Support filter chains: pre- and port-filters to MIMEFILTERS.

=> Hashify all resources (part of code redesign).

=> Use message-IDs as filenames: Internal impacts, OS support problems.
   Should be configurable?
